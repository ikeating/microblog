A great set of 35 mm photographs from my time as a DNR Park Ranger at [Itasca State Park](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/park.html?id=spk00181#homepage) during the summer of 1995.  Many memorable adventures including removing pesky cubs from garbage dumpsters, recovering a stolen boat, and a recovery effort after straight line winds slammed a large portion of the park...which I somehow slept through.  My living quarters were located within Douglas Lodge so of course I needed to show respect to Wallace Douglas:)
